# 🛍️ Discount Calculator — Save That Cash!

Welcome to the **Discount Calculator** — the Python-powered sidekick you didn’t know you needed for your shopping math! Whether you’re hunting sales or just curious about the price drop, this little script will do the thinking for you. 💸🧠

## 🎯 What Does It Do?

This script helps you figure out how much you'll *actually* pay after a discount — **but only if the discount is 20% or more**. Because let’s be real... anything less than 20% isn’t even worth getting out of bed for. 😴

## 🧠 How It Works

1. It asks you for:
   - The **original price** of an item 🏷️
   - The **discount percentage** you're getting 💯

2. If the discount is **20% or more**, it calculates the new price and shows you how much you saved. 🤑

3. If the discount is **less than 20%**, it politely tells you that you’re still paying full price. 💀
